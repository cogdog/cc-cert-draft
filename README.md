# Contents for CC Certification Draft 2.0

Making this because editing the spreadsheet is a bear-- converted the spreadsheet content to Markdown.

Fork this repo! and make derivatives for versions based on meeting feedback. Will be easier to work on this if you are added as a collaborator -- [submit an issue](https://github.com/cogdog/cc-cert-draft/issues). Then you can make direct edits here rather than forking. But if you like forking, go for it.
